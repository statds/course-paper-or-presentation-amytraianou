## Association between Breast Cancer and Hepatitis C Virus with Age Controlling

In Egypt, Hepatitus C virus infection is a common problem that often impedes treatment
of breast cancer in female patients. While previous work has analyze an associaiton 
between HCV seropositivity and breast cancer diagnosis, this paper will focus on the 
potential confounding of age on the association. We will use Fisher's Exact Test to
estimate the crude estimate of the association and the Mantel-Haenszel method to 
stratify the data between ages. The possible effect of age in the association can
lead to improved care for patients.
